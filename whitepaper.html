Welcome to DOTRA â€” a fair, community-driven mining project.

ðŸ”¹ Mining
Start mining by tapping the "Start Mining" button once every 24 hours. A countdown shows when you can mine again. Only active participants are rewarded.

ðŸ”¹ Proof of Activity
By actively engaging daily, users demonstrate continuous support and contribute to the communityâ€™s growth. Each mining session earns a reward through the Base-Mining Process.

ðŸ”¹ Referral System
Invite friends to DOTRA! For every active referral, you receive a bonus of 0.05 DOTRA. Help grow the community naturally.

ðŸ”¹ Tokenomics
Total Supply: 100,000,000 DOTRA
- 90% for mining rewards to the community
- 10% reserved for the founding team (with vesting)

ðŸ”¹ Roadmap
- Phase I: Beta release (App launch, mining starts)
- Phase II: Community expansion, KYC verification, voting features
- Phase III: Blockchain integration on Polygon, Testnet launch
- Phase IV: Exchange listings, audits, further decentralization

ðŸ”¹ KYC Verification
To ensure fairness and security, KYC (identity verification) will be mandatory for users who want to withdraw or use their mined DOTRA. Mining is still possible without KYC, but usage is restricted until verification is complete.

ðŸ”¹ Community Voting
DOTRA is community-driven. Future updates, features, and major decisions will be made through user votings. Every verified user will have the right to vote.

ðŸ”¹ Blockchain Future
DOTRA plans to integrate with the Polygon network, offering fast, affordable, and eco-friendly transactions. Deployment will occur after community and mining base have been established to ensure a fair launch.

ðŸ”¹ Why Polygon?
- Very low gas fees
- High scalability
- Environmentally friendly (Proof-of-Stake)
- Compatible with Ethereum ecosystem

ðŸ”¹ Project Lead
DOTRA is developed and maintained by Kerim Kurt. The project is independent and bootstrapped with a strong focus on transparency, community and fairness.

ðŸ”¹ Important Notice
DOTRA is an experimental project. There are no guarantees of future value or success. Participation is voluntary.

Let's mine the future â€” together.
